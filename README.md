# BIOS 611 Project on World Happiness Report
> The World Happiness Report ranks the happiness score of more than 150 countries based on six explanatory factors:
* GDP per capita
* Social support
* Healthy life expectancy
* Freedom to make life choices
* Generosity
* Perceptions of corruption
> This project plans to achieve the following objectives:
* Assess how much each explanatory factor explains the happiness score in a country for a given year.
* Show the changes in the happiness scores and the changes in the rankings for a given region or country from 2015 to 2022.
* Compare the changes in the happiness scores to the changes in the prevalence of mental health disorders in selected countries with a high prevalence of mental health disorders and those with a low prevalence of mental health disorders from 2015 to 2022.
* Assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on happiness scores and on the six explanatory factors using world happiness data from 2019 to 2022.
> The main motivation is that by examining how changes in economics, social structures, politics, and personal perceptions are associated with the changes in the happiness scores, we might better understand what measures we could take at each of the different levels to improve the quality of life.
